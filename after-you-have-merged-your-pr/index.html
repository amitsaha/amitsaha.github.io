        <h1>Your PR has been merged. What next?</h1><time>June 16, 2019</time></header><p>You have just implemented your next big feature, your pull request has been merged,  testing looks good and you want to roll it out to your users. But, have you thought about monitoring, observability, and logging?  These three things are usually an afterthought. They shouldn&rsquo;t be. On this page, I will point to resources and discuss about the things that we should always be thinking about before rolling out our code change into any kind of production environment. We will learn about good logging practices, effective monitoring strategies and writing code which allows us to find out what&rsquo;s going on when something goes wrong.</p>
