# You Can't Unit Test C, Right?

[Talk Overview](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/114/)

## Notes

- Unit test
  - test my code, not somebody else's
  - Dependency injection, mock
- C mocking and stubbing
- Coverage analysis
- framework - [check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/), [tutorial](https://libcheck.github.io/check/doc/check_html/check_3.html)
- framework - [atf](https://github.com/jmmv/atf) and [kyua](https://github.com/jmmv/kyua/)
  - kyua - list tests
  - generate html reports
- Tests for functions such as malloc:
  - Write a new implementation of malloc() - look up the real malloc using dlsym()
  ```
  void *malloc(size_t size) {
      return real_malloc(..)
  }
  ```
- `--coverage` and [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) flag to generate coverage data
- Testing `main()`
  - override main() to something else using preprocessor directives
  - actually execute it
  - Or keep main() as small as possible

# Understanding git, even the scary parts

[Talk overview](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/117/)

## Notes

- Blob object
  - Git's representation of the version of a file
- Tree object
  - Lists contents of directory
  - Stores which filenames
  - Points to blobs
- Commit object
  - Contains commit metadata
  - Points to corrresponding tree object
  - Points to previous commit
  - Can have two parents - for a merge commit
- Branches
  - lightweight movable pointer to a commit
  - adding a commit, pointer moves
- Rebase and merge
  - Fast forward merge
  - Merge commit
  - Rebase commit
  - Both achieve the samething
    - rebase: linear history
    - merge: stitching pattern
- `git log --graph --oneline --all`
- [git reflog](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-reflog)
- git diff styles: `diff3`
- [git rerere](https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/03/08/rerere.html)

# Source Code Generation: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Boilerplate

[Talk overview](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/119/)

- Code generation
  - Few developer mistakes
  - Saves developer time
  - Introduce your favorite idioms or patterns project-wide
  - Laziness-induced anti-patterns can be avoided
  - Automatically write code generators for different languages
- OpenAPI/Swagger
- GNU Autogen
- Generated code is stateless
  - Avoid committing generated code
  - Code generation is part of the build process
  - Schema needs to be versioned

# In from the cold: Finally making Linux and .NET get along

[Talk overview](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/121/)

- `Tmds.DBus` + C# to interact with system DBus
- Always target `netstandard*`
- Test on multiple distros
- Be aware of logging
- cross platform CI/CD
