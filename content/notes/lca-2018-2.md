# Puppet in the cloud

[Talk overview](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/163/)

## Notes

- Why config management?
- Even in the age of k8s and containers, config management matters!
- Puppet has CA and cert model for authenticating clients (in server model)  - Not cloud scalable
- Use `roles` (via EC2 tags)
- server boots -> Ask puppet to sign cert -> .. : exposes a attack vector
- Autosigning is very dangeorous - if you get it wrong
- Policy based autosigners
- Use single use token to sign initially
- github.com/carnivalmobile/carnival-autosign-aws-puppet
- Untrusted facts are dangerous
- Trusted facts
- [r10k](github.com/puppetlabs/r10k)
- High availability
- Bake AMI using puppet - don't rely on applying puppet manifests at provision time
- Masterless puppet - pupistry
