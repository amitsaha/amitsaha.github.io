# The Meson Build System - 4+ years of work to become an overnight success

[Talk overview](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/39/)

## Notes

- [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com/)
- Build system for multiple languages
- One specification, multiple languages
- Modern OSs and toolchains
- Scales to thousands of source files
- Minimizes the time developers have to interact with the build system

Example:

```
$ ./meson.py init ..
```
- [Tutorial](http://mesonbuild.com/Tutorial.html)
- Conforms to distro layout requirements
- Cross compilation
- Users: `Gstreamer`, `systemd`, GNOME projects, NetworkManager, Wayland
- Why - when we already have `cmake`, `autotools`?
- Until you have your first major customer, you have nothing
- [WrapDB](http://mesonbuild.com/Using-the-WrapDB.html)

- Switch between user shells: `ros console list`
- [cloud-config](https://rancher.com/docs/os/v1.1/en/configuration/#cloud-config) to orchestrate ROS based systems
- customisation happens using `cloud-init` at first boot
- RancherOS `init/init.go`
- [LinuxKit](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit) micro linux distro
- [RancherOS built using LinuxKit](https://www.slideshare.net/mobyproject/using-linuxkit-to-build-custom-rancheros-systems)
