# You Can't Unit Test C, Right?

[Talk Overview](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/114/)

## Notes

- Unit test
  - test my code, not somebody else's
  - Dependency injection, mock
- C mocking and stubbing
- Coverage analysis
- framework - [check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/), [tutorial](https://libcheck.github.io/check/doc/check_html/check_3.html)
- framework - [atf](https://github.com/jmmv/atf) and [kyua](https://github.com/jmmv/kyua/)
  - kyua - list tests
  - generate html reports
- Tests for functions such as malloc:
  - Write a new implementation of malloc() - look up the real malloc using dlsym()
  ```
  void *malloc(size_t size) {
      return real_malloc(..)
  }
  ```
- `--coverage` and [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) flag to generate coverage data
- Testing `main()`
  - override main() to something else using preprocessor directives
  - actually execute it
  - Or keep main() as small as possible

# Understanding git, even the scary parts

[Talk overview](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/117/)

## Notes

- Blob object
  - Git's representation of the version of a file
- Tree object
  - Lists contents of directory
  - Stores which filenames
  - Points to blobs
- Commit object
  - Contains commit metadata
  - Points to corrresponding tree object
  - Points to previous commit
  - Can have two parents - for a merge commit
- Branches
  - lightweight movable pointer to a commit
  - adding a commit, pointer moves
- Rebase and merge
  - Fast forward merge
  - Merge commit
  - Rebase commit
  - Both achieve the samething
    - rebase: linear history
    - merge: stitching pattern
- `git log --graph --oneline --all`
- [git reflog](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-reflog)
- git diff styles: `diff3`
- [git rerere](https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/03/08/rerere.html)

**Learning to read git conflicts**

I often have difficulty in understanding conflicts in files when I do a `rebase`.
They usually look like this:

```
Hello World
Edit from master
<<<<<<< HEAD
Second edit from master
||||||| merged common ancestors
=======
Edit from branch1
>>>>>>> edit from branch1
```

I am using [diff3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27417656/should-diff3-be-default-conflictstyle-on-git)
as the merge conflictstyle here (thanks to the speaker) for this one! Then I read
this [article](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/)
and now I think it finally makes sense. The `HEAD` here really refers to the commit I am rebasing my
changes on `top of`. That is, when I do `git rebase master`, the HEAD above refers to the commit
of the master branch. The text above `====` refers to the changes in that branch and below to the
changes in mine.
