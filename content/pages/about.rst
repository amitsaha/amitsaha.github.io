About
=====

My name is Amit, I am interested in programming, software tools and infrastructure. I
like sharing what I learn and know via my writings and talks. I try and take time out
to learn from first principles when learning something new. If I cannot do it then,
I come back to it. A lot of what I explore in software makes it to my 
GitHub profile (@echorand).
