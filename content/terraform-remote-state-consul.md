In my new post on the CodeShip blog, I discuss configuring terraform with a consul remote backend. The entire aricle is available
[here](https://blog.codeship.com/terraform-remote-state-with-consul-backend/).

The accompanying git repository is [here](https://github.com/amitsaha/terraform-consul-lock-demo/). Please file an issue
if you have trouble following the setup.
