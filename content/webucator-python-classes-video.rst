`Webucator <https://www.webucator.com/>`__ recently created a video based on my `Python classes: beyond the absolute basics <http://echorand.me/site/notes/articles/python_custom_class/article.html>`__ article. 

You can see the video on `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0slsoyEhz40&feature=youtu.be>`__  or here below:

I think they really did a great job with it and supplements my article well.
