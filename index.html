        <h3>About</h3>

<p>I am a programmer who likes to teach via his writings. I feel strongly in favor of the possibilities Open Source has opened up and try to keep all my codes/articles accessible to everyone with an appropriate license. Perhaps I should also say that I am not anti-Microsoft. The way they brought computers to the reach of the ordinary people was revolutionary. However, with the world changing around them, they should also change.</p>

<h3>Why I believe in Open Source?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Open Source fosters sharing, and everything I learn and teach is meant to be shared with everyone. </li>
<li>Open Source allows you to follow your curiosity.</li>
</ul><h3>Code</h3>

<p>I mostly code in C and Python these days, besides the odd BASH scripting. Perhaps more useful code (snippets) would be found on my <a href="https://gist.github.com/amitsaha">Gist profile</a> than <a href="https://github.com/amitsaha" class="user-mention">@amitsaha</a>.</p>

<h3>Writings</h3>

<p>I have written quite a lot over past several years. They used to be mostly articles for print, online and digital magazines. You can take a look at them <a href="http://echorand.me/writings/">here</a>. </p>

<p>However, off-late considering that my ultimate motivation in writing is really to teach and I want my writings to reach the maximum audience, I have abandoned the idea of writing for other people. I am beginning to and will continue to write articles on my personal <a href="http://echorand.me">blog</a>.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>I worked for three years on Evolutionary Algorithms. It was fun. Computational Science excites me.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>

<p>I am always open to help you with a programming/technical question you may have. I may not know the answer, but I will probably be able to point you in the right direction. So, if all hopes have been lost, feel free to contact me. You can find my contact details on my blog.</p>
