        <h1>Use of &#34;transparent&#34; in computing</h1><time>September 15, 2021</time></header><p>One word that has always baffled me in the context of software/computing is “transparency”.  “This change is completely
transparent to the application” - or some version of it is often used to tell consumers of an application/library that
a certain change won’t be noticeable by the consumer at all. If I were to put in my English language hat on
(a non-native at that), i would think that means “so, the consumer will see the change” and not the intended
“the consumer will not see the change”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(human%E2%80%93computer_interaction)">wikipedia article</a> on the topic Transparency (human–computer interaction) mentions this
(towards the end of the first paragraph) which states my own sentiment well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of the times, the term transparent is used in a misleading way to refer to the actual
invisibility of a computing process, which is also described by the term opaque, especially with regards
to data structures.[citation needed] Because of this misleading and counter-intuitive definition, modern
computer literature tends to prefer use of &ldquo;agnostic&rdquo; over &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, i am going to start consciously using  “agnostic” from now on. At least, my mental model now is clear.
And I will know that i am not the only one confused by this.</p>
