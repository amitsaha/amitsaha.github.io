        <h1>Data only Docker containers</h1><time>December 13, 2015</time></header><div class="document">


<p>In this post, we shall take a look at the idea of data only
containers - containers whose sole purpose is to exist on the <em>docker
host</em> so that other containers can have portable access to a
persistent data volume.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-do-we-need-a-persistent-data-volume">
<h2>Why do we need a persistent data volume?</h2>
<p>We will experiment with the <tt class="docutils literal">jenkins</tt> image from the <a class="reference external" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/">docker
hub</a>. Let's run a jenkins
container using <cite>$ sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins</cite>. Now, if we
visit the URL <cite>http://docker-host-ip:8080</cite>, we will see the familiar
Jenkins home page.</p>
<p>By default, a Jenkins installation doesn't come with any
authentication configured. Hence, we will first setup a simple
authentication setup using Jenkins' own user password database. To do
so, we will visit the URL:
<cite>http://docker-host-ip:8080/configureSecurity/</cite> and check the <tt class="docutils literal">Enable
security</tt> checkbox and then select the <tt class="docutils literal">Jenkins</tt> own user database`
option, and check the <tt class="docutils literal">Allow users to sign up</tt> check box under
<tt class="docutils literal">Security Realm</tt>, select the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Logged-in</span> users can do anything</tt>
option and finally click on <tt class="docutils literal">Save</tt>. This will bring us to the login
page from where we can create a new account since we don't have one
yet. Now, we will exit out of the container - we can use <tt class="docutils literal">Ctrl + c</tt>
combination for that. Now, if we restart the container using the
previous command, you will see that none of the configuration changes
above has been saved.</p>
<p>The reason for that is because none of the changes we make during a
container's lifetime in it's own file system is preserved. So, we need
<em>data volumes</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="persistent-data-with-a-volume-mount">
<h2>Persistent data with a volume mount</h2>
<p>If you look at the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a>
you will see the command <tt class="docutils literal">VOLUME /var/jenkins_home</tt>. This
essentially means that the mount point <tt class="docutils literal">/var/jenkins_home</tt> points to
a location on the docker host. Hence, the changes made in that
directory will be available from the host even after you have exited
the container. However, the catch here is that every time you run a
new container, the host location it mounts to will change and hence as
we saw above, the data we wrote (via the configuration changes) were
not visible the next time we started a container from the same
image. To achieve that, we have to do things slightly differently. We
will start the container and give a name to it:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">`
$ sudo docker run <span class="pre">-p</span> 8080:8080 <span class="pre">--name</span> jenkins jenkins
`</tt></p>
<p>We will perform the same configuration changes above and exit the
container using Ctrl + C. Next, we will <tt class="docutils literal">start</tt> the container using
<tt class="docutils literal">sudo docker start jenkins</tt>. You will see all your changes have been
preserved.</p>
<p>So, now we have a setup of jenkins where our changes are preserved, so
long as we make sure we start/stop the containers and not run a new
container from the <tt class="docutils literal">jenkins</tt> image. The key point to take away from
here is that for a specific container, the host directory the volume
maps to is always the same. This leads to the use of what is commonly
referred to as <tt class="docutils literal">data containers</tt> for persistent data storage in
containers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-data-containers-for-persistent-storage">
<h2>Using data containers for persistent storage</h2>
<p>The idea here is that you use the same base image from which your
actual container will run to only create a container (using <tt class="docutils literal">docker
create</tt>), not run it:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
$ sudo docker create --name jenkins-data jenkins
</pre>
<p>We gave the name <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">jenkins-data</span></tt> to this container and it's only
purpose is to be there on our filesystem to serve as a source of
persistent <tt class="docutils literal">/var/jenkins_home</tt> for other jenkins containers. Let's
run a jenkins container now:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
$ sudo docker run --volumes-from jenkins-data -p 8080:8080 jenkins
</pre>
<p>As earlier, we can now go to the Jenkins home page at
<cite>http://docker-host-ip:8080/configureSecurity/</cite> and make the above
configuration changes. You can now exit the container and use the
above command to run another jenkins container. The changes will still
be visible. We are no more restricted to starting and stopping the
same container since our <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">jenkins-data</span></tt> container will have all our
changes stored in its <tt class="docutils literal">/var/jenkins_home</tt>. You can have other
containers (perhaps a container for
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/discordianfish/docker-lloyd">backing up</a> your
<tt class="docutils literal">/var/jenkins_home</tt>) being able to access the same data by using the
same <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">volumes-from</span></tt> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparison-to-volume-mounting-a-host-directory">
<h2>Comparison to volume mounting a host directory</h2>
<p>The alternative to using data containers is to mount a directory from
the host as <tt class="docutils literal">/var/jenkins_home</tt> in the container. This approach will
solve our end-goal, but there are two additional steps that one would
need to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Decide which host location to use, perhaps creating it</li>
<li>Making sure the container will have appropriate read-write permissions (including <a class="reference external" href="www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/06/using-volumes-with-docker-can-cause-problems-with-selinux/">SELinux
labels</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't need to do either of these when using data containers. As
long as the image we plan to use has the appropriate <tt class="docutils literal">VOLUME</tt>
command in it's Dockerfile, we can adopt the same approach we did
here to make sure the data we care about is persisted. For images,
which don't, we can easily enough create our own image and add the
appropriate <tt class="docutils literal">VOLUME</tt> commands. And hence, this is a <strong>portable</strong>
approach to data persistence - it is not reliant on the host
setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, these are the main reasons why data containers are a
good approach to have persistent storage for your containers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No requirement to setup host</li>
<li>The permissions are automatically taken care of since we are using the same base image</li>
<li>Multiple containers can easily have access to the same data</li>
</ul>
