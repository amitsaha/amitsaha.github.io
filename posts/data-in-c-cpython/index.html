        <h1>Data in C and CPython</h1><time>January 26, 2018</time></header><div class="document">


<p>In the last two articles (<a class="reference external" href="http://echorand.me/data-in-cpython.html">Data in CPython</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://echorand.me/data-in-c.html">Data in C</a>), as it
turned out, I discussed two fundamental points in each language:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What happens in an assignment operation (such as <tt class="docutils literal">a=2</tt>)?</li>
<li>Are separate copies of data created or references passed to the original when
they are sent as function parameters?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I will summarize the findings by presenting a
comparative analysis.</p>
<div class="section" id="assignment">
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>The simplest way to explain the difference between an assignment
operation in C and that in CPython is as follows.</p>
<p>Assignment is a <em>copying</em>
operation in C. The data on the right side of the expression is <em>copied</em>
into the memory location pointed to by the left hand side of the
assignment statement. This is irrespective of whether this data exists
anywhere else in the current scope. This is simply because of the fact
that data in C has no usable existence unless stored in a variable,
and no two variables in C will occupy the same location in
memory. Thus, you will have multiple copies of the same data in
each of these variables, if there are assignment statements to this
effect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an assignment statement is a <em>binding</em> operation in
CPython. This again follows from the fact that in CPython, data is an
<cite>object</cite> and occupies a location in memory. Thus, data has existence
without a variable identifying it. However, like C, to refer
to the data object, you need a <cite>binding</cite> to it. This binding is what
you would usually call a variable. However, that is where the
similarity with variables in C ends. As I discussed in the article on
CPython, depending on whether the data is mutable or immutable,
multiple bindings point to different or same memory location. For
example, if you have two assignment statements, <tt class="docutils literal">a=2</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">b=2</tt>
(<tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> data items are immutable), the <tt class="docutils literal">id(a) == id(b)</tt> will evaluate to
<tt class="docutils literal">True</tt>. However, if the statements were <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a=[]</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b=[]</span></tt>
(<tt class="docutils literal">list</tt> data items are mutable), <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">id(a)==id(b)</span></tt> will evaluate to
<tt class="docutils literal">False</tt>. What happens when you create a new binding from an existing
binding? You will have one more binding to the original object. As
discussed in the article on CPython, depending on whether the original
object is mutable or not, any change in it will either propagate to
the copies or not.</p>
<p>The following graphic attempts to present the differences between the
two languages visually.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="function-parameters">
<h2>Function parameters</h2>
<p>In case of C, the parameters are either passed in a <cite>call by value</cite>
fashion or in a <cite>call by reference</cite> fashion. As we saw in the article
on C, the type of the data being passed determines this.</p>
<p>CPython, on the other hand <em>always</em> passes bindings to the original data objects. Depending
on whether the data object is mutable or immutable, semantics of the
propagation of changes to the original object are determined.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This article marks the conclusion of this admittedly limited in scope
three part series looking at how the most fundamental data types in C
and Python behave differently from each other. However, I think I can
now finally say that after writing these three articles, I have
finally got a clear picture of working with mutable and immutable
data in Python and how they differ from C.</p>
