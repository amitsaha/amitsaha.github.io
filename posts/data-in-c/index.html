        <h1>Data in C</h1><time>January 26, 2018</time></header><div class="document">


<p>In C, the data you use in your programs will usually fall into one of the three
basic categories: <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">char</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt>. Data in C has no
existence without an associated memory location labeled by an
<tt class="docutils literal">identifier</tt>, usually referred to as a <cite>variable</cite> (the term variable
is a bit misleading, since it essentially means that it must always
vary, but you can have <cite>constant variables</cite> - i.e. variables whose
values do not vary). Considering this and C's requirement for <cite>static
typing</cite>, a <cite>variable declaration</cite> statement is required before data
can be stored in a variable. This declaration statement usually takes the
form of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data-type</span> <span class="pre">var-name</span> [= value]</tt>, where the <cite>=value</cite> part may
or may not be present. For example, the statement <tt class="docutils literal">int a=1;</tt>
declares a variable <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> which will store integer data and stores
<tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> in it. What this statment basically tells the C compiler is
that it should allocate a block of memory large enough to store an
integer and it will referred to as <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt>. It is possible to obtain the
address of this memory location using the <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;</tt> operator.</p>
<p>Listing: address.c</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int a=1;

    printf(&quot;Address of a:: %p, Data in a:: %d\n&quot;, &amp;a, a);

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>When you compile and run the above program, you should see an output
similar to the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Address of a:: 0x7fff0cadd1ac, Data in a:: 1
</pre>
<p>You should note that the exact value of this address is immaterial
for us and it will definitely be different for you. Once you have this
address, it is possibly to refer to this memory location without using
the variable, <cite>a</cite>, by making use of the <cite>dereferencing</cite> operator,
<tt class="docutils literal">*</tt>.</p>
<p>Listing dereferencing.c</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int a=1;
    int *ptr;

    printf(&quot;Address of a:: %p, Data in a:: %d\n&quot;, &amp;a, a);

    ptr = &amp;a;
    *ptr = 2;

    printf(&quot;Address of a:: %p, Data in a:: %d\n&quot;, ptr, a);

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>When you compile and execute the above program,  you will see an
output similar to the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Address of a:: 0x7fff85a7f134, Data in a:: 1
Address of a:: 0x7fff85a7f134, Data in a:: 2
</pre>
<p>In the above program, we store the address of the variable <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> in
the variable <tt class="docutils literal">ptr</tt> (declared as an integer pointer variable) in the
statement <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ptr=&amp;a</span></tt>. Next, we use the dereferencing operator to change
the integer stored at memory location to <tt class="docutils literal">2</tt>. Now, when we retrieve
the data stored at <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt>, we get back the new integer.</p>
<p>Pointers are variables themselves and hence you could use the
<tt class="docutils literal">&amp;</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">*</tt> operators on them as well. For the purpose of this
article, we will just be needing pointers to non-pointer
variables.</p>
<div class="section" id="assignment">
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>The declaration statement <tt class="docutils literal">int a=1</tt> also includes an optional
<cite>assignment</cite> operation. It is not mandatory to assign a value while
declaring a variable. Thus, the above statement can be broken down to
two statements:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int a;
a=1;
</pre>
<p>The second statement is an assignment statement and the <tt class="docutils literal">=</tt> is known
as the assignment operator. In C's terminology, the term on the left
hand side is called the <cite>lvalue</cite> and the term on the right hand-side
is called the <cite>rvalue</cite>. The <cite>lvalue</cite> must itself be a memory location
or an identifier identifying a valid memory location and must be
capable of storing new data. Thus, a variable initially declared
as a <tt class="docutils literal">const</tt> cannot be used as a <cite>lvalue</cite>. The <cite>rvalue</cite> should
itself be data of the same type as the <cite>lvalue</cite> or an <cite>expression</cite> which
evaluates to it. (I hope to discuss <cite>lvalue</cite> and <cite>rvalue</cite> will be
discussed in a later article.)</p>
<p>The main point to note here is that assignment is simply the copying
of data on the right hand side into the memory location pointed to by
the left hand side (either using a variable name or using the direct
memory location  by using the dereferencing operator). You can use the
assignment operator on variables which store numbers and single
characters. For arrays, except during declaration, you have to use
specialized functions (in case of strings) or assign each a value to
each element individually.</p>
<p>The next code listing illustrates assignment operation and presents a
few other related ideas.</p>
<p>Listing: mut_data.c</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/* Variables are by default mutable.

   Two variables occupy different locations in memory even if
   they may be storing the same data.

*/
# include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int a = 1;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int b;

    /*Copy the value stored in a to b*/
    b = a;

    /* A no-op operation*/
    2;

    /* The &amp; operator expects an 'lvalue' as an operand, and hence
    the following statement will result in a compilation error.
    */
    /*printf(&quot;Address of 2 %p\n&quot;, &amp;2);*/

    printf(&quot;Address of a: %p, Address of b: %p\n&quot;, &amp;a, &amp;b);
    printf(&quot;a = %d b = %d \n&quot;,a,b);

    /* Change value stored in the memory location identified as a.
    */
    a = 2;

    printf(&quot;Address of a: %p, Address of b: %p\n&quot;, &amp;a, &amp;b);
    printf(&quot;a = %d b = %d \n&quot;,a,b);

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>In the above program, we declare <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> as an integer variable and
store the integer <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> in it. Next, we declare another integer
variable <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> and assign it to <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> in a separate statement. As
mentioned earlier, what this operation does is simply copy the
contents of <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> into <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt>. The data stored in <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> is
now <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt>. The next statement in our program is <tt class="docutils literal">2;</tt> - is a valid
primary expression, but since the <cite>result</cite> of this evaluation is not
being stored, there is no way you are going to be able to refer to
this particular <tt class="docutils literal">2</tt> anywhere else in this program. Hence an attemp
to retrieve the <cite>address</cite> of this particular <tt class="docutils literal">2</tt> will result in
compilation errors, because only lvalues have addresses. Next, we
print the addresses of the variables <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt>. As expected,
each has a different address in memory, even though they have the same
memory contents. Sample output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Address of a: 0x601034, Address of b: 0x7fffb3a8565c
a = 1 b = 1
</pre>
<p>Next, we change the value stored in <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">2</tt> which is visible in
the next part of the output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Address of a: 0x601034, Address of b: 0x7fffb3a8565c
a = 2 b = 1
</pre>
<p>The above output establishes that even though, <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> was originally a
copy of <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> (storing the same data), in case of any changes to the
&quot;original&quot; variable, any of its copies do not see the changes. Each of
these variables are completely isolated from each other. With this
idea, we proceed to discuss the semantics of <cite>call by value</cite> and <cite>call
by reference</cite> while passing data as function parameters. However,
before we can discuss this, we will learn about the <cite>base address</cite> of
an array.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="base-address-of-an-array">
<h2>Base address of an array</h2>
<p>An array (say, declared as <tt class="docutils literal">int a[10]</tt>) is an instruction to the
compiler that a block of memory for storing 10 integers should be
allocated and identified by <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt>, with individual items being
addressed as <tt class="docutils literal">a[0], <span class="pre">a[1]...a[9]</span></tt> (and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0,1,..</span></tt> known as the
indices). The operation, <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;a[0]</tt> returns the address of the first
element of this array.</p>
<p>Now, what does the compiler understand when we simply ask it do
something like this <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">printf(&quot;%d&quot;,</span> *a)</tt>? In case of an array
variable, when we use only the variable name (without an index), it
refers to the address of the the element, <tt class="docutils literal">a[0]</tt>. That is,
<tt class="docutils literal">&amp;a[0]</tt>. Thus <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">printf(&quot;%d&quot;,</span> *a)</tt> is actually <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">printf(&quot;%d&quot;,</span>
<span class="pre">*(&amp;a[0]))</span></tt>. We will refer to the address of the first element of an
array as its <cite>base address</cite> to aid the rest of the discussion.</p>

<h2>Function parameters</h2>

</pre>
<p>In the <tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> function, we declare an integer variable, <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and
two character arrays (strings), <tt class="docutils literal">string1</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">string2</tt>. When you
compile and run this program, you will see four &quot;sets&quot; of output:
<cite>Before call to func()</cite>, <cite>Before modification in func()</cite>, <cite>After
modification in func()</cite> and <cite>After call to func()</cite>. First, I will
discuss the first two sets:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Before call to func()
Address of a: 0x7fff6549ad7c
Address of string1: 0x7fff6549ad70
Address of string2: 0x7fff6549ad60
a = 5
string1 = A String
string2 = B String

Before modification in func()
Address of a: 0x7fff6549ad2c
Address of string1: 0x7fff6549ad70
Address of string2: 0x7fff6549ad60
Address of string3: 0x7fff6549ad30
a = 5
string1 = A String
string2 = B String
</pre>
<p>The key thing to note in the above output is the addresses of the
three variables. (We discuss <tt class="docutils literal">string3</tt> a little later on, so ignore
it for now).</p>
<p>You can see that the address of <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> is different in
<tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> and in <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt> functions. This is because, the function
<tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt> is creating a new variable <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> to store the value being
passed to it from the <tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> function (it is immaterial that we
are using the same variable name in both the same functions - each of
these variables are local variables, having no existence beyond the
functions themselves). This is what is referred to as <cite>call by
value</cite> - a copy of the value in a variable is passed from the calling
function to the called function.</p>
<p>The addresses of the two character array variables are however the
same in both the functions. This automatically follows from the
discussion on <cite>base address of an array</cite>. When the function <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt>
is called from <tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt>, passing the array variables, <tt class="docutils literal">string1</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">string2</tt> mean that we are passing the base address of each
these arrays to the function, <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt>. Hence, the two variables
<tt class="docutils literal">string1</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">string2</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt>, actually refer to the same
memory location as <tt class="docutils literal">string1</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">string2</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> (Once
again, the same variable names is irrelevant).</p>
<p>Now, we consider the next set of output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
After modification in func()
Address of a: 0x7fff6549ad2c
Address of string1: 0x7fff6549ad70
Address of string2: 0x7fff6549ad60
Address of string3: 0x7fff6549ad30
a = 6
string1 = F String
string2 = G String
</pre>
<p>We make some changes to the data stored in each of the three variables and
this is reflected in their changed values.</p>
<p>Finally, consider the last set of output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
After call to func()
Address of a: 0x7fff6549ad7c
Address of string1: 0x7fff6549ad70
Address of string2: 0x7fff6549ad60
a = 5
string1 = F String
string2 = B String
</pre>
<p>In the <tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> function, the data stored in <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> is the same as
it was before the call to <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt>, the data stored in <tt class="docutils literal">string1</tt>
is same as after the modification in <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt> and that of
<tt class="docutils literal">string2</tt>, the same as it was before calling <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt>.</p>
<p>From the first set of output, we know that the variable <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> in
<tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt> was a separate variable from the <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> and
thus any changes made to the data stored in former will not be
reflected in the latter. From the same set of output, we also know
that <tt class="docutils literal">string1</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt> pointed to the same <tt class="docutils literal">string1</tt> in
<tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> and hence any changes made to it is reflected in the
latter. So, what's happening with <tt class="docutils literal">string2()</tt>? The reasoning about
<tt class="docutils literal">string1</tt> should also apply to <tt class="docutils literal">string2</tt>, and it does. However,
the difference in the output is due to the statement:
<tt class="docutils literal">strcpy(string3, string2)</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt>. In this statement, we are creating a
copy of the data in <tt class="docutils literal">string2</tt> and storing it in a new variable
<tt class="docutils literal">string3</tt>. Since <tt class="docutils literal">string3</tt> is a new variable (as demonstrated by
the different address) as seen in the above sets of output, any
changes to the value of <tt class="docutils literal">string3</tt> is not reflected in
<tt class="docutils literal">string2</tt>. In fact, you may call this as cheating when I printed the
data in <tt class="docutils literal">string3</tt> and as that in <tt class="docutils literal">string2</tt>. I did this to
demonstrate a use case where you may need to change the value of an
array parameter without changing the original array.</p>
<p>This form of calling a function where the addresses (or references) to
the parameters are sent from the calling function to the called
function is referred to as <cite>call by reference</cite>. Thus, we can conclude
that when arrays are passed, it is by default a <cite>call by reference</cite>,
where as for data types such as <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">char</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">value</tt>, it is
<cite>call by value</cite>.</p>
<div class="section" id="explicit-call-by-reference">
<h3>Explicit call by reference</h3>
<p>As we have seen, we get <cite>call by reference</cite> for free in the case of
arrays. How do accomplish this for <cite>int</cite>, for example? The key is to
pass the address of the variable from the calling function to the
called function. The next code listing demonstrates this.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>When you compile and execute the above program, you will see an output
similar to the following :</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="call-by-value-for-an-array">
<h3>Call by value for an array</h3>
<p>We have now understood that arrays are by default <cite>call by

as an integer array where you can create a new array with the contents

<p>However, a well-known generic strategy to accomplish this from the <cite>calling</cite>

<p>In the above code listing, we first define a structure
<tt class="docutils literal">string_wrapper</tt> with a character array as a member. This is because
we plan to use this structure to wrap a string. If we wanted to use
this for wrapping an integer array, we would have an integer array as
the structure member. In the <tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> function, we copy the data in
string variable <tt class="docutils literal">astring</tt> to the structure member, <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> using
<tt class="docutils literal">strcpy()</tt>. Next, we call <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt> using this structure member
instead of the string variable. This allows us to pass the data in
<tt class="docutils literal">astring</tt>, instead of the variable itself.</p>
<p>When you compile and execute the above program, you should see the
following output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
String: A String
String: F String
String: A String
</pre>

<h2>Immutable data</h2>
<p>If you want to enforce the restriction that the data stored in one or
more of your variables shouldn't be changed from what was assigned
during <cite>declaration</cite> of the variable, use the <tt class="docutils literal">const</tt> keyword during
declaring the variable. For example, <tt class="docutils literal">const int a=1</tt> declares an
integer variable <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and stores <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> in it. If you attempt to make
any changes to it in the rest of the <tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> function, your
compiler will not compile your program, telling you that this is not
allowed. It is important to note that you have to store the data
during declaration itself. The next code listing demonstrates this.</p>
<p>Listing: immut_data.c</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int a = 1;
    const int b = a;

    /* This is not allowed as well
   const c;
   c=1;
   */

  /* Even though this is the same value as already stored in a,
     this is not known to the compiler at compile time. Hence, the
     following statement will result in a compile time error*/
  /*b = a;*/

  printf(&quot;Address of a: %p, Address of b: %p\n&quot;, &amp;a, &amp;b);
  printf(&quot;a = %d b = %d \n&quot;,a,b);

  return 0;
}

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we have taken a look at the basics of how data in C
has no identity if not stored in memory locations identified by
identifiers. We also learnt about <cite>call by value</cite> and <cite>call by
reference</cite> and how different data types behave differently when passed
as function parameters.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Python, you may be interested in my article
on <a class="reference external" href="http://echorand.me/data-in-cpython.html">data in CPython</a>. In my next article, I will summarize these two
articles highlighting the differences between the two.</p>
