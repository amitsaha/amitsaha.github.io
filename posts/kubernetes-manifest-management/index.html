        <h1>On managing Kubernetes YAML manifests</h1><time>December 20, 2019</time></header><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>There are two broad discussion points in this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Managing the lifecycle of Kubernetes YAML manifests</li>
<li>Static guarantees/best practices enforcements around Kubernetes YAML files <em>before</em> they are applied to a cluster</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="prior-art-and-background">Prior art and background</h2>
<p>Please read <a href="https://blog.cedriccharly.com/post/20191109-the-configuration-complexity-curse/">this article</a> to
get a more holistic view of this space. What follows is my summary of what I think is the state at this stage
and how it fits in with my two gols above.</p>
<p>The top two pain points (as far as my understanding goes) with managing YAML manifests for Kubernetes resource are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent &ldquo;YAML duplication&rdquo; across similar functional resources and environments</li>
<li>Data validation</li>
</ul>
<p>The solutions to the the first issue above has been solved via mechanisms such as &ldquo;helm templates&rdquo;
and &ldquo;kustomize&rdquo;. Perhaps, one can combine both these to completely solve the YAML duplication problem
as well as implement a hierarchy of YAML files. The data validation problem can be solved via a relatively
new &ldquo;data configuration language&rdquo;, called <a href="https://cuelang.org">cue</a>. In fact, <code>cue</code> aims to help solve
the YAML duplication issue as well as it supports &ldquo;templates&rdquo;. And it seems like, using packages may be a way
to solve the hierarchy problem as well. Essentially, as far as I understand, these three tools all work on the
principle that the final &ldquo;output&rdquo; will be a YAML file which is ready to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.
The article I link to above has links to other non-YAML alternatives such as <a href="https://github.com/cruise-automation/isopod">isopod</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-kubernetes">dhall-kubernetes</a>.</p>
<p>Coming back to the requirements I stated in the beginning of the document, there is a good chance we
can meet the requirement (1) with either &ldquo;helm template&rdquo; + kustomize or &ldquo;cue&rdquo; itself. The requirement
(2) stated above can be satisfied with tools like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval">kubeval</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/clusterlint">clusterlint</a> (More for cluster wide usage)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit">kubeaudit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/controlplaneio/kubesec">kubesec</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations-of-prior-art">Limitations of prior art</h2>
<p>All the solutions discussued in the previous section still need that initial &ldquo;seed&rdquo; configuration to be
specified for a Kubernetes resource manually in some form - a helm chart, a kustomize base YAML or a cue specification.
That is, a human operator is needed to copy/paste or write a new YAML/Cue file from scratch for each service
and then have the overrides in each environment to establish the hierarchical setup. In addition, it will involve
using one or more external tools. &ldquo;helm&rdquo; specifically adds too much complexity for us (IMO), even though
the latest release has removed the need for the server-side tiller component. &ldquo;kustomize&rdquo; is a simple tool,
but it doesn&rsquo;t help with the initial seed template generation. Writing various plugins as a way
to customize its behavior is possible, but does involve substantial effort. &ldquo;cue&rdquo; is a promising tool, but it has a steep
learning curve for little gain as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition we will need to solve the problem (2) with more than one third party tool.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-solution">Proposed solution</h2>
<p>The solution will solve the initial hand generation of configuration by making it a tool&rsquo;s responsibility. It will take
the minimal set of command line arguments, pass it through various validation, policy enforcements and if all that
succeeds, will spit out the YAML configuration ready to be deployed. This solution will also be used to enforce and
continuously scan for any policy violations by existing manifests. So, any policy updates will be enforced.</p>
<p>As a starting point, the tool supports the concept of a &ldquo;service&rdquo; as the only top-level
generate-able object. A service may have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A worker deployable</li>
<li>A DB migration job</li>
<li>A cron job</li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage, it only supports the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one container per pod</li>
<li>Only supports persistent volumes and secret volumes</li>
<li>No IAM role support</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t allow resource limit setting</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now, the CLI interface looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Error: accepts 1 arg(s), received 0

  mycli service generate-k8s [flags]

      --container-image string       Container image to run in the pod (only AWS ECR registries allowed)

<h2 id="improvements-to-the-above-generation">Improvements to the above generation</h2>
<p>With the above command, we generate the initial set of manifests for an environment. We have the following limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to do the above per environment: <code>qa</code>, <code>staging</code>, <code>production</code>, etc.</li>
<li>We essentially have duplication across environments, althought not hand written or copied</li>
<li>If we wanted to change something across all environments, we will have to manually edit each environment&rsquo;s manifests</li>
<li>For the same kind of service  (<code>redis</code>, <code>db</code>), we will need to do the same operation over and over again</li>
</ol>
<p>All the above problems can be solved by instead generating the seed configuration for <code>kustomize</code> or <code>helm</code> instead
of plain YAML files. For example, <a href="https://github.com/mr-karan/kubekutr">kubekutr</a> generates <code>kustomize</code> bases based
on user input.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could enhance our above generation command as follows. We will consider two kinds of deployment units:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom services</li>
<li>Standard services - DBs, Storage services, Cache</li>
</ul>
<p>For custom services, using the command line parameters, create a specification for your application. Then using this specification,
generate manifests for each environment. This will solve 1, 2 and 3 above. If we want to change something across
all or a specific environments, we will change the specification. Let&rsquo;s consider example specifications:</p>
<pre><code># For an external PHP service with a
# Web, Worker, DB migration jobs and a Cron job

Kind: PHPService
Project: hello-world
Type: External
Host: api.hello-world.xcover.com
Port: 8443
Container:
  Image: 121211.aws.ecr.io/hello-world-api:&lt;githash&gt;
DBMigration: true
CIServiceAccount: true
CronSchedule: &quot;* * * * *&quot;
Environments:
  qa:
    Namespace: hello-world-qa
    WebReplicas: 2
    WorkerReplicas: 2
    EnvVars:
      Environment: qa
      TruncateDB: true
    NodeGroup: hello-world_qa
  staging:
    Namespace: hello-world-qa 
    WebReplicas: 3
    WorkerReplicas: 3
    EnvVars:
      Environment: staging
    NodeGroup: hello-world_staging
EnvVars:
  secret:
  - name: TOKEN
    path: hello-world-api/token
  plain:
  - name: APP_NAME
    value: hello-world
PersistentVolumeClaims:
  - name: data
    mountPath: /storage
    size:5
</code></pre><pre><code># For an external Python service with a
# Web, Worker, DB migration jobs and a Cron job

Kind: PythonService
Project: hello-world
Type: External
Host: api.hello-world.xcover.com
Port: 8443
Container:
  Image: 121211.aws.ecr.io/hello-world-api:&lt;githash&gt;
DBMigration: true
CIServiceAccount: true
CronSchedule: &quot;* * * * *&quot;
Environments:

    Namespace: hello-world-qa
    WebReplicas: 2
    WorkerReplicas: 2
    EnvVars:
      Environment: qa
      TruncateDB: true
    NodeGroup: hello-world_qa

PersistentVolumeClaims:
  - name: data
    mountPath: /storage
    size:5

</code></pre><p>For deploying standard services which will be deployed in multiple environments across multiple
applications, the following specification will be generated using in-built custom parameters, thus
minimizing the number of user inputs:</p>
<pre><code>Kind: Redis
Project: hello-world
Type: Internal
Port: 6379
Container:
  Image: 12121.aws.ecr.io/redis-infra:&lt;git bash&gt;
Environments:
  qa:
    Namespace: hello-world-qa
    NodeGroup: xledget_qa
PersistentVolumeClaims:
  - name: data
    mountPath: /redis-data
    size: 5
...
</code></pre><p>We can do the same for other standard services like PostgreSQL, etc.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-use-kubekutr--kustomize">Why not use <code>kubekutr</code> + <code>kustomize</code>?</h3>
<p>The above solution aims to make it straighforward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate initial multi-environment YAML manifests</li>
<li>Make subsequent changes across environments</li>
<li>Not require experience with another tool</li>
</ul>
<p><code>kubekutr</code>&rsquo;s scope is limited to generating <code>kustomize</code> bases. That way, the proposed tool&rsquo;s scope
is more extensive as well as being self-contained - not needing another tool.</p>
<p>The workflow we are aiming for with the proposed tool is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the above tool</li>
<li>Run standard linting/checks</li>
<li>Run <code>kubectl apply</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brain-dump">Brain dump</h2>
<p>In the last three years while writing puppet classes/modules, chef recipes, terraform configuration
and most recently Kubernetes YAML files, i have felt that I am writing the same stuff over and over
again. Generating these configurations have often been at the back of my mind. I was losing quite a
bit of sleep (literally!) over this again with Kubernetes manifests. I sent a Twitter DM to Kelsey
Hightower briefly explaining to him what I am trying to do here. One of his sentences was &ldquo;Configuration
is complicated&rdquo; (paraphrased slightly) which was the moment for me when I realized that this is not
the first time I have been trying to think about generating configuration rather than copy/pasting them
and hand-editing them. He also mentioned that he likes the idea of &ldquo;pipelines&rdquo;. Something could be
generating the configuration and something else could be validating it and may be sending pull requests
to fix the issues.</p>
