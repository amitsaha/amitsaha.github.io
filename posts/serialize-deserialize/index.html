        <h1>Serialization</h1><time>September 18, 2021</time></header><p>I always get confused between &ldquo;serialization&rdquo; and &ldquo;deserialization&rdquo;. Perhaps, that is
because I am trying to memorize what they are, and then trying to recall from memory.
Of course, it&rsquo;s sufficient to remember only one of them correctly.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s my trick that I am going to use from now on. It is derived from this Wikipedia
article on the subject, in the Drawbacks section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serialization breaks the opacity of an abstract data type by potentially exposing private implementation details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I want to <em><em>S</em>tore</em> some data that we have in an application&rsquo;s memory as an object of some
<em>abstract data type</em>, we serialize it. For example, serializing a <code>struct</code> in Go to a JSON file on disk.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013606/http://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/serialization#serialize-overview">reference</a> from the Wikipedia
article explains serialization in this manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It lets you take an object or group of objects, put them on a disk or send them through a wire
or wireless transport mechanism, then later, perhaps on another computer,
reverse the process: resurrect the original object(s). The basic mechanisms are to flatten object(s)
into a one-dimensional stream of bits, and to turn that stream of bits back into the original object(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Like the Transporter on Star Trek, it’s all about taking something complicated and turning it into a
flat sequence of 1s and 0s, then taking that sequence of 1s and 0s (possibly at another place, possibly
at another time) and reconstructing the original complicated “something.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the understanding I obtained based on reading the Wikipedia article and the above reference, I serialized it by
writing this blog post. Or did I deserialize it? Who knows.</p>
