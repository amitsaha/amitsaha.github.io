        <h1>PyCon US 2022 Talk - Implementing Shared Functionality Using Middleware</h1><time>May 30, 2022</time></header><p>I delivered a talk at the recently concluded <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/">PyCon US 2022 conference</a>.</p>
<p>Amazing conference, great work by the organizers and everybody involved. This was my third time
at PyCon US and my first time participating in the post conference sprints. I contributed
to the Pyodide project during the sprints, and was a great experience to work with the core
developers during the sprints and for a couple of days after the sprints. I also had a great
time speaking to so many people, discussing my talk, my book, their talks, and their work.</p>
<p>It was also great to speak to participants who were able to attend the conference, thanks
to grants from Pyladies. This was a great reminder to me of the impact that PSF and Pyladies
are having via their work.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://ehmatthes.com/blog/pycon_2022_highlights/">great recap</a> by another attendee
about how they experienced the conference.</p>
<h2 id="my-talk">My talk</h2>
<p>My talk was titled &ldquo;Implementing Shared Functionality Using Middleware&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While preparing this talk, I went on a journey that taught me so much about
WSGI applications, ASGI applications and how the different frameworks implement
middleware internally.</p>
<p>Some of my biggest insights which I had and implemented myself are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing a WSGI middleware allows one write a framework independent middleware</li>
<li>Using WSGI middleware, we can run a Flask and Django application in the same app server</li>
<li>Using a middleware it is possible to run WSGI and ASGI applications in the same
appserver</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope I was able to communicate all my own learnings effectively via my talk.</p>
<p>The video is now available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t7GxTbKocc">here</a>.</p>
<p>Slides and Demo code are available <a href="https://github.com/prod-python/pycon-us-2022">here</a>.</p>
<p>I want to take a moment to acknowledge PyCon providing a free service for speakers
to have a session with a speaking coach. That was really very helpful in improving
my own talk delivery and presentatition.</p>
