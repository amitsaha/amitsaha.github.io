        <h1>A virtualenv first approach to Python projects</h1><time>November 30, 2015</time></header><div class="document">


<p>I have until the last few months (of my ~4 years of working with
Python) always worked without virtualenv for all my Python
projects. Why? I think I found the whole idea of having to do the
following two steps before I work on something cumbersome:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Remember the exact virtualenv name, and then</li>
<li>Activate it</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I was very much aware that it was certainly a good thing
to do and would cause me less headaches someday. That someday finally
came, and I ran into conflicting package requirements for applications
which needed to run simultaneously. This forced me to start using
virtualenvs. I think I also found the tool which will make me  keep
using them even when I don't <em>need</em> to. The tool is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/berdario/pew">pew</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="installation-and-basics">
<h2>Installation and Basics</h2>
<p>The home page lists various options of installing <tt class="docutils literal">pew</tt>. The most
straightforward is of course to just use <tt class="docutils literal">pip install pew</tt>. Once you
have it installed, typing <tt class="docutils literal">pew</tt> lists the various sub-commands, such
as <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">workon</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">ls</tt> and others. Eac of the sub-commands is
accompanied by a summary of they will do.</p>
<p>So far, I have been mostly working with the above sub-commands. Here
is how we can create a new virtualenv:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
$ pew new flask-graphql-demo
New python executable in flask-graphql-demo/bin/python2
Also creating executable in flask-graphql-demo/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip...done.
Launching subshell in virtual environment. Type 'exit' or 'Ctrl+D' to return.
flask-graphql-demo $
</pre>
<p>Our virtualenv <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flask-graphql-demo</span></tt> is created and we are in it, which we can check:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
$ which pip
~/.local/share/virtualenvs/flask-graphql-demo/bin/pip
</pre>
<p>We can do all our usual work now (installing other packages, running
our applications) and once done, we can simply <tt class="docutils literal">exit</tt> and we will be
out of the virtualenv.</p>
<p>Now, if I want to resume work on this particular project, I can first
use <tt class="docutils literal">pew ls</tt> to list the currently created virtualenvs:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
$ pew ls
flask-graphql-demo
</pre>
<p>and then use <tt class="docutils literal">pew workon <span class="pre">flask-graphql-demo</span></tt> to start working on it
again. On Linux, <tt class="docutils literal">pew workon</tt> also gives me all the available
virtualenvs as suggestions automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you may have already seen, <tt class="docutils literal">pew</tt> has a number of other features
which should make working with <tt class="docutils literal">virtualenvs</tt> really easy. It has
definitely made me change my approach to working on Python projects.</p>
